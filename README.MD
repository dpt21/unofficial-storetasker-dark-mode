# Unofficial Storetasker Dark Mode

A simple Chrome/Chromium extension to view the Storetasker experts interface in dark mode.

This extension was set up by feeding the expert portal's HTML to AI. Over time, I added more selectors as I discovered elements that still retained their original style.
Surely there are many more such elements - if you discover any of them, please submit a pull request with the appropriate CSS selectors.


## Installation & Usage

1. Navigate to your browser's Extensions menu and enable Developer Mode
2. Click "Load Unpacked" and select this directory
3. Customize the theme by modifying `styles.css` 
   - Use specific CSS selectors for precise targeting
   - Add `!important` declarations where necessary to override existing styles
4. After making changes, click the "Reload" button in the Extensions dashboard to apply updates
